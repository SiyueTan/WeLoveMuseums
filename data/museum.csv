The museum is housed in a two-storey neoclassical building, which was constructed in 1903 on the site of an earlier mansion belonging to the Kalokerinos family. The second building, designed by K. Tsandirakis, was clearly influenced by morphological features of the earlier one, and was later listed as a historical monument. The new museum extension to the west constituted an attempt to combine traditional and modern architecture. The original goal of those founding the Historical Museum of Crete was to collect and preserve valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical material deriving from the medieval and modern periods in Cretan history. The process of enriching the collections, extending exhibition space and redefining the museum's aims has never ceased. Prolific research and publishing activity, the organisation of temporary exhibitions, educational programmes and the use of audiovisual media all form part of the modern educational role adopted by the Historical Museum of Crete over time.

In its unique history, it has assembled works from the early fifteenth century to the present. The Kunstmuseum Basel houses the Galerie (Gallery) and the Kupferstichkabinett (Department of Prints and Drawings). The main focus is on paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600 and of the 19th and 21st century. The Kunstmuseum Basel possesses the world`s largest collection of works by the Holbein family. Further examples of Renaissance art include major pieces by masters such as Konrad Witz, Martin Schongauer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Matthias Grnewald. Most of these early treasures originally belonged to the collection of a Basel lawyer, Basilius Amerbach. Purchased by the city in 1661, they formed the core of the world`s first public municipal museum. Paintings by Basel-born Arnold Bcklin feature among the 19th-century highlights. In the field of 20th-century art, the accent is on Cubism (Picasso, Braque, Lger), German Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism and American art since 1950.

The Museo del Novecento was established on 6 December 2010 with the goal of spreading knowledge of 20th century art and offering a more comprehensive insight into the collections that the city of Milan has inherited over time. Beside its core exhibition activity, the Museum is active in the conservation, investigation and promotion of 20th century Italian cultural and artistic heritage with the final aim of reaching an ever wider audience. With an eye toward the city, the Museo del Novecento develops around multiple locations. The Permanent Collection follows a chronological path where collective exhibitions alternate with solo art shows. The grand spiral staircase inside the building welcomes visitors and introduces them to the visit of the Museum with the Il Quarto Stato (The Fourth Estate) by Pellizza da Volpedo. The bookshop and the restaurant are the Museum's meeting places. The Neon by Lucio Fontana represents a final embrace to the city. Reflecting Milan's feverish cultural dynamism, the Permanent Collection is essentially the story of several private collections that have been brought together thanks to the generosity and passion for art of many private collectors. Since its inception, the collection has been augmented by major gifts from artists, collectors and philanthropists who play an active role in the growth of the Museum's heritage, which today reflects the rich trajectory of art from the early 20th century through the present. An outstanding example of architecture and, today, an impressive installation communicating directly with the city, since 2010 the Palazzo dell'Arengario has accommodated the Museo del Novecento. This landmark building, designed by Griffini, Magistretti, Muzio, and Portaluppi, was renovated by the Rota Group to host a richly layered collection of 20th century Italian art. The transformation of the Palazzo dell'Arengario was dictated by the need to organize the composition of Milan's Civiche Raccolte d'Arte (Municipal Art Collections) around two distinct poles. While the historic premises of Villa Reale were meant to host collections dating from the 19th century, the Palazzo dell'Arengario was singled out for the exhibits of 20th century artwork. The latter was particularly meaningful for the harmony existing between its architecture and the collection it was meant to display. This project enabled to best exploit the interior premises, while turning the building into one of the major cultural places in Milan. The grand spiral staircase inside the building is probably the most impressive architectural feature of the Museum: a functional element that connects several levels, from the subway up to the panoramic terrace overlooking the Duomo.",1,NA,9.1901492,45.4633108,1-2 hours ,Museo del Novecento,+39 0288444061,28,4.5,"1,197",622,Museums,Art,Orange,,,,,

The KGB museum was founded by the organization Chernyy dozhd. This non-governmental private organization is a community of people who are fascinated with the history collected unique items related to the activities of the Soviet Secret Service. The presence of many exhibits is primarily due to anarchy and lack of control over many state museums in the USSR during its division into many independent states, which used to be former Soviet socialist republics. Only due to the Chernyy dozhd organization many priceless exhibits were saved from looting, destruction and recycling. This is the first time in the world memorabilia previously belonging to the first persons of the Soviet Union, the heads of the Cheka-NKVD-GPU-OGPU-MGB-KGB and the senior functionaries of the soviet state security are put together in one place.The exhibition features absolutely unique exhibits such as Lenin death mask, which was made in January 1924 by Doctors of Medicine Vorobiev and Zbarsky (the authors of the unique embalming technique of dead body); the weapon, which was used for Trotskys murder in Mexico in 1940; the personal belongings from the cabinet of Beria, who was Marshal of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), a chief of the Soviet security service during the difficult years of World War II, and later a supervisor of the Soviet atomic bomb project; an unusual type of small arms, chemical weapons, made according to then-advanced technology, and many other exhibits. A part of the exhibition showcases the history of the personal standard weapon of the Soviet secret service officers.In the 20th century such kind of technique was actively developed, designed and produced by secret laboratories, institutes and specialized factories of Warsaw Pact countries, and especially by the Soviet Union.Gifted scientists, talented designers and highly skilled engineers with unique abilities were engaged into this invisible and closed for ordinary people industry.Hidden cameras (in the Soviet Union they used the term ""tacit photography""), things which were used for keeping secret information (dead drops), instruments for applying signal labels, standard gifts for the officers and employees of the KGB to celebrate various anniversaries in the history of the USSR and the KGB, the first merit badges of the agents, and all the things which were inextricably connected with the activities of Soviet intelligence officers can be seen now at the KGB Museum in Prague. A part of the exhibition is dedicated to the so-called ""Prague Spring"". Many unique photos of the city streets were made by the KGB agents during the events of 1968. Unusual photos reflect the dramatic history of that time, the tragedy of the beautiful old European city, which fate became a bargaining chip in a great gamble game of superpowers. One can also see an extraordinarily beautiful handmade banner that had been made by the children from the GPU labour commune for 2 months and was presented to Grampa Lenin in the autumn 1923, three months before his death. After the Soviet state heads death the banner, as well as the flags from the GPU NKVD RSFSR, had been held over the World Proletariat Leader's body in the House of Unions' Pillar Hall for 3 days. In that frosty cold January of the year 1924 a three day procession of more than a million people walked past the Lenin's coffin..
